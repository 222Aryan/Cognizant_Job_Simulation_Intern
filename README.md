# Cognizant AI Forage Simulation Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the completion of Cognizant's Artificial Intelligence simulation on Forage. The tasks completed in this simulation include:

1. Completed a job simulation focused on AI for Cognizant’s Data Science team.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis using Python and Google Colab for one of Cognizant’s technology-led clients, Gala Groceries.
3. Prepared a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team.
4. Communicated findings and analysis in the form of a PowerPoint slide to present the results back to the business.

## Project Structure

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis conducted using Python and Google Colab.
- `model_training.py`: Python module containing code to train a machine learning model and output performance metrics.
- `presentation_slides.pdf`: PowerPoint slides presenting findings and analysis to the business.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `data_analysis.ipynb` to view the exploratory data analysis.
3. Use the `model_training.py` module to train a machine learning model and output performance metrics.
4. Review the presentation slides `presentation_slides.pdf` to understand the findings and analysis.

## Dependencies
